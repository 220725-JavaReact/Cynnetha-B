# Cynnetha-B
## Introduction
- First and foremost, my name is not Cynthia, that is actually my moms name. No worries, Marielle said my name wrong for at least a week or so of our previous training. LOL My nickname is CeeBee (which you guys are free to call me. However due to professional reasons I understand if you must call me Cynnetha). 
- I am from Brooklyn New York
- I have a 11 year old son (Soon to be 12 the end of August) who stresses me out daily lol
- At the age of 5 I fell in love with basketball. I played all through middle school, highschool and even had a scholorship for it in college. 
- I am a huge Lebron fan so where ever he goes I go; with that being said I am currently a Lakers fan. 
- Cable is a waste-Netflix for the win!
